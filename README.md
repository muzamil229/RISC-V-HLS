# RISC-V-HLS
Design and Simulation of an RV32I RISC-V Processor Core Using High-Level Synthesis

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a RISC-V RV32I-based System-on-Chip (SoC) using the Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool.

Overview
  The implementation follows a two-stage approach:

  Stage 1: Design and simulate the base integer instruction set (RV32I) using C++ in Vitis HLS.

  Stage 2: Simulate the Verilog code generated by HLS alongside a memory unit to verify functionality through synthesis.

Objectives
  Simplify HDL development by leveraging HLS to convert C++ code into synthesizable HDL.

  Maintain readability and clarity of the code without compromising on performance or resource efficiency.

Verification & Testing
  Functional correctness is first verified within HLS.

  Further simulation using Verilog ensures the correct behavior of core components such as the register file, program counter, memory, and ALU.

FPGA Implementation
  Final implementation was tested on an Artix-7 AC701 FPGA at 100 MHz.

Results:

  Total on-chip power consumption: ~151 mW

Resource utilization: Very low

  This approach shows how HLS can effectively bridge the gap between software-level design and hardware-level implementation, offering a streamlined workflow for developing RISC-V-based SoCs.
